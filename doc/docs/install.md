# Install

## Depend on it 
Run this command:

With Flutter:

```shell
$ flutter pub add local_file_preferences
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
local_file_preferences: ^0.0.2
```

Alternatively, your editor might support `flutter pub get`.

Check the docs for your editor to learn more.
 
## Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:local_file_preferences/local_file_preferences.dart';
```
